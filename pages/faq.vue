          <strong>What are the rules for traveling with an infant or toddler under the age of 2?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>
          <span class="bold-text">For Domestic Travel:</span> An infant is considered a child from 0-24 months. You may travel with infant in lap at no additional charge. For added comfort and security in flight, most airlines suggest you purchase a seat for the infant. Infants occupying a seat are subject to the full adult fare. You may be required to provide proof of age (such as a birth certificate or passport) at the airport for any children.
        </p>
        <p>Please visit the airlines website for airlines specific rules and regulations, for child safety seats/stroller/bassinet information.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="bold-text">For International Travel:</span> For an international travel, a separate ticket is required for every infant whether it’s in lap or in a separate seat. Depending on the destination, the airline may offer a discounted fare for the infant. Please note that most infant tickets purchased via our website for international travel require a paper ticket. A shipping fee of $19 for the USA or $38 for Canada will apply. Tickets may only be shipped to the billing address.
        </p>
        <p>You may also reserve and purchase the infant ticket directly from the airline. You must provide them with the accompanying adult ticket information. Some airlines have different rules and regulations regarding infants. We highly recommend you visit the airlines website for their specific rules and regulations.</p>
        <p>
          When an adult travels with 2 infants, the adult may only hold ONE infant. An additional seat at the adult fare must be purchased for the 2nd infant. Maximum number of infants per adult is 2. For airport security information related to traveling with infants and children, please visit the TSA website at:

        <br />
        <h5>

        <h4 class="head-deatilpage">PAYMENT PROCESS</h4>
        <br />
        <h5>
          <strong>How do I pay for all travel products such as air tickets, insurance, hotels etc. purchased online?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>The form of payment accepted to purchase online is a valid US or Canadian credit or debit card. Debit cards may be used but are generally subject to low daily limits that may cause the payment process to be rejected, i.e. Credit card declined. We accept the following types of major credit cards: American Express, Visa, Master Card, Discover, and Diners Club. If you do not have a valid credit card then tickets may not be purchased on-line. Only one card may be used to purchase the ticket(s) on a given reservation.</p>
        <p>To complete the purchase process you will need to enter information about the credit card and have this information validated before a ticket or a final confirmation is issued. If the entered credit card information is not valid then an error will be generated and an e-mail sent to you (at the e-mail address specified by you) indicating that the credit card has been declined. In order to keep the reservation you must call the Help Desk on our Toll Free number 1888-220-3565 and provide the Representative with valid credit card information within 24 hours of making the reservation, or the reservation may be terminated. Please be aware we have no control of the airlines taking their seats back for inventory purposes from an un-ticketed reservation without notice. Most credit card declines are the result of inaccurate information being entered into the website payment page such as transposing credit card digits, having the wrong security code or expiration date, or the name on the card and address are inconsistent. These problems can be remedied by simply calling Help Desk and correcting the entered data.</p>
        <br />
        <h5>
          <strong>Can I pay for the ticket with a Debit card?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>Although Credit Cards are suggested, we do accept Debit cards with Visa or Master card logos on them. Debit cards normally have a lower daily spending limit which can cause complications when purchasing an airline ticket online. It is highly recommended you contact your bank prior to purchase to ensure the daily spending limit will cover the cost of ticket(s). Please advise them you are purchasing tickets online. This may also protect you from a security block being placed on your account. Also please note that Debit cards have a stricter fraud screening which can cause delays in confirmation. If for any reason your card is declined, you will be notified via email. Please be advised you will be responsible for contacting your bank to clear up any problems. The airlines have the right to lapse the fare and cancel the reservation when full payment is not received.</p>
        <br />
        <h5>
          <strong>Do you accept prepaid credit cards?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>We accept most pre-paid credit cards however; we highly recommend using a standard credit card. The bank’s processing time, flexibility and ability differs greatly from that of a debit or credit card.</p>
        <br />
        <h5>
          <strong>Are all prices in US Dollars?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>All of our fares are listed in US Dollars. As stated on our home page, all of our prices are quoted in US dollars. We do accept Canadian credit/debit card and the final charges on your Canadian statement will be in Canadian Dollars after our price quote has been converted from US Dollars. Since the currency exchange rate is based upon your credit card company’s conversion rate tool at the time your charge is processed, your final amount may vary.</p>
        <br />
        <h5>
          <strong>Do you accept Canadian Credit/ debit cards?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>Yes, we do accept Canadian credit/debit cards for payment. The amount will be converted to Canadian dollars and these amounts are what will appear on your billing statements. Since the currency exchange rate is based upon your credit card company’s conversion rate tool at the time your charge is processed, your final amount may vary.</p>
        <br />
        <h5>
          <strong>I have a non US, non Canadian credit card, can I use it?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>CheapAirHub.com has recently started allowing credit cards issued outside the US/Canada to be used as a form of payment for certain itineraries. There are some stipulations involved and in even rarer cases additional fees collected. If CheapAirHub.com does require certain documents and/or charge a fee you will be prompted on the site prior to you accepting and clicking purchase.

        <br />
        <h5>
          <strong>Why was my credit card declined?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>There are many reasons a card can be declined. Some problems include: insufficient funds, low daily spending limit, billing address verification failed, and internet fraud screening. Please know that in most cases the airline will only allow a flight request to hold for 24hrs before the fare expires and the request is canceled. You will be notified if your card is declined and you will have to contact the credit card company to clear up the problem. Once the problem is resolved you can call our Help Desk, 24 x 7 to have the ticket processed.</p>
        <br />
        <h5>
          <strong>Is there a service fee for purchasing my ticket through the website?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>Yes, all service fees and taxes are included into your final total when searching online for a flight. You are able to click on the "taxes/fees" choice to see a breakdown of all separate amounts that create your final total and amount charged to your card</p>
        <br />
        <h5>
          <strong>Why are there different charges on my credit card?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>You will see separate charges on your credit/debit card for accounting reasons. However, when all amounts are added up they will not exceed the final amount you agreed to pay online.</p>

        <br />
        <h5>

Once the airline has fully confirmed and issued your tickets you will receive a second and final email confirming your request. If you did not receive a final confirmation, it may be because your internet provider has blocked it as possible spam. Please take a moment to check your spam/junk folder.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>
          <strong>What if I have not received my confirmation email with My Booking reference code?</strong>

        <p>Once you have completed the online request you will instantaneously receive an email acknowledging your request which will include a booking reference code.

        <br />
        <h5>

        </h5>
        <p>
          If you need another copy of your itinerary you can use your booking reference code to take a print by following these instructions: your reference code is a 6 character code that will either be made up of both letters and numbers or just letters only.

        <br />
        <h5>
          <strong>I have a confirmed reservation on 2 or more airlines. Why are you unable to issue my ticket?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>Some airlines do not have ticketing and/or baggage transfer agreements with each other therefore causing the itinerary you chose to be invalid and unable to be confirmed and ticketed by the airline. If this situation arises your request will be cancelled and nothing will be charged to your card.</p>
        <p>You can then proceed to go back online to choose an alternate itinerary or call on our Toll free number 1888-220-3565 for assistance.</p>
        <br />
        <h5>
          <strong>Do I have an Electronic Ticket or paper ticket for my reservation?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>Our system is programmed to automatically issue e-tickets. If the airline prohibits an e-ticket due to some technical reasons, we will notify you within 24 hours of your booking. An additional Fedex shipping charge will be applied to your total charges if you agree for Paper Tickets.

        <h5>
          <strong>I purchased a paper ticket, how will I receive it?</strong>
        </h5>

        <h5>
          <strong>Why did I not receive my tickets in the mail?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>If you have not received tickets in the mail it is most likely because you were issued electronic tickets (e-tickets). If you were issued e-tickets your email confirmation serves as your ticket receipt. The airline will only require a valid government issued ID such as a passport/Drivers license/state ID in order to check in and receive a boarding pass.</p>
        <br />
        <h5>
          <strong>I did not receive my paper tickets in the mail, what should I do?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>
          If you purchased paper tickets our shipping department will send them via Fed Ex and will also send an email to the traveler advising the Fed Ex tracking number in order for you to track your package. The tickets are normally sent with a 3 day delivery but can take longer if over a weekend/holiday. You can use your tracking number on the

        <p>Unfortunately Fed Ex will not deliver to a PO Box, FPO, or APO address. If you are certain you have a paper ticket, you will need to contact our shipping department to supply us with your physical mailing address in order to have your tickets shipped.</p>
        <br />
        <h5>
          <strong>Can I receive the tickets to a different mailing address?</strong>

        <p>We are not able to ship to any other address than the one attached to the billing credit/debit card being used.</p>


        <h4 class="head-deatilpage">TRAVELING PROCESS</h4>
        <br />
        <h5>
          <strong>How do I travel with an electronic ticket?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>Electronic tickets (e-tickets) make traveling convenient as it eliminates the worry of loss or theft of your paper tickets. You will be required to carry government issued photo identification (such as driver’s license or passport) for check-in, to the airport.</p>
        <p>Some airlines may allow check-in online and print your boarding pass up to 24 hours in advance. Passengers must have a printed boarding pass in order to proceed through security and those who do not have a boarding pass should go to the airline ticket counter prior to going through the security checkpoint.</p>
        <p>It is advisable that you reconfirm your flights at least 72hrs prior to departure directly with the airline.</p>
        <br />
        <h5>
          <strong>What identification do children need at the airport?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>For domestic travel in the U.S., passengers under the age of 18 are not required to have identification. However, the adults who are responsible for the child at the departure airport and arrival airport are required to have identification. While the airlines typically do not specify the identification required for the adult who drops off or picks up the child, the same kinds of photo identification that an adult uses for airline travel should be sufficient and/or a valid Birth Certificate.</p>
        <p>If a child is traveling unaccompanied on an international flight, there may be additional requirements such as Passports/Visas. Depending on the circumstances, you may need to have additional documentation to allow a child to leave the departure country or to enter the destination country. Contact the appropriate authorities for each involved country to ensure that all requirements are being met.</p>
        <br />
        <h5>
          <strong>What are the rules on unaccompanied minors traveling alone?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>Most airlines allow unaccompanied children at or above a certain age to fly, though usually with several restrictions. Programs vary widely from airline to airline, and no two airlines will have the same polices, which is why we suggest you to call us on our Toll free number 1888-220-3565 for assistance or make direct reservations with the airline for unaccompanied minors.</p>
        <p>In the U.S., there are no clear regulatory guidelines with respect to unaccompanied children, so it is important that you take the time to understand the specific policies of the airline and then make the reservation.</p>
        <br />
        <h5>
          <strong>Why do I have to change airports?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>Itineraries will sometimes involve an airport transfer when certain airlines don’t fly to your requested destination from one airport to another such as EWR and JFK in New York City. The switch of airports is carried out at the travelers own expense and will require the traveler to collect their luggage and transfer to the next airport where he/she will then check-in with the next scheduled airline. Most itineraries that involve a switch of airports are normally priced lower which is why it is offered as a viable option on the website.</p>
        <br />
        <h5>
          <strong>What is the check- in procedure for domestic and international flights?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>When packing, please remember that new Federal carry-on rules allow for only one standard-size carry-on bag and one personal item such as purse, laptop computer, small book-type backpack or briefcase.</p>
        <p>The Transportation Security Administration requests travelers not to lock their checked luggage. If your bag is locked and there is a need to inspect the bag, the locks will be removed by security. New Federal security rules require customers who have checked baggage to fly on the same flight as their checked bags. If you are checking your bags, be sure your name and contact information is on the outside and inside of each bag.</p>
        <p>If you're checking bags for a domestic flight, you should arrive at the airport 90 minutes prior to departure. If you only have carry-on luggage, plan to arrive 60 minutes prior to departure. For international flights, it's recommended that you arrive at least two hours prior to departure. For international flights all passengers will need their passports.</p>
        <p>Have your government-issued photo ID available at all times, as well as a printed itinerary if you're traveling with an electronic ticket. As per FAA rules, if you are traveling on a domestic flight with a child or children under the age of 18, they do not need a photo ID as long as the accompanying adult certifies their identity. It is advisable that you reconfirm your flights at least 72hrs prior to departure directly with the airline to ensure that no last minute schedule changes have occurred.</p>
        <p>
          If you wish to reconfirm your flights with the airlines or if you have any questions about a particular airline's rules, please contact the airlines directly. For a list of airline phone numbers, please visit the

          <strong>What are the latest passport requirements for US citizens traveling to/from Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>Most U.S. citizens must use a U.S. passport to travel overseas and reenter the United States. A passport is an internationally recognized travel document that verifies your identity and citizenship. Only the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Embassies and Consulates have the authority to issue or verify U.S. passports.</p>
        <p>
          Most foreign countries require a valid passport to enter and leave. Some countries may allow you to enter with only a birth certificate, or with a birth certificate and a driver’s license,

For many land or sea trips this means you can travel using the new U.S. passport card instead of the normal passport book. Read more about

          <br />• Official government issued picture identification like a current driver’s license or a photo ID card, which can be issued to non-drivers by your state’s motor vehicles department, or a passport (of course) or two forms of non-photo identification (one needs to be state-issued)

          Passport, visa, and health requirements vary by country of destination. Make sure you get all the information you need well in advance of your trip. Passports are now required for all U.S. citizens traveling to or from the United States via air, to/from Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean (with the exception of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands), and Bermuda. These requirements have been temporarily modified because of the high demand and the State Department’s inability to meet the needs in a timely manner. Refer to
